# survey_center

This is a simple survey tool built to give potential employers a look at some code I've written.
It will present the user with a quesiton and some possible answers, once the user has selected an answer they can submit and see the results of that quesiton so far. 

Based on the timeframe and purpose of this project I did do a couple of things differently than I normally would:
- I would ususally use bower for my client side components and add the js.lib folder ot my .gitignore but, today bower and require were not being friends so I just got rid of bower all together and put the needed .js files in my repo for easy start up
- I would probably use a client side framework for most web apps, but since the requirement only called for one page with a couple of ajax calls I decided to just do it with a couple of helpers and jQuery
